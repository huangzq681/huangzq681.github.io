	abstract = {The unprecedented 2022 Yangtze River Basin (YRB) heatwave is a threat to human society and natural ecology, so the understanding of its underlying drivers is critical to regional climate adaptation and resilience. Here we conducted a multi‐method attribution analysis on the contribution of atmospheric circulation change and anthropogenic impacts to the occurrence probability and intensity of this extreme heatwave. Based on the nonstationary statistical analysis, the 2022 YRB heatwave is a 1‐in‐900‐year event and a 1‐in‐110‐year event with and without considering the 2022 YRB heatwave in the fitting, respectively. The large‐scale meteorological condition analysis shows that the 2022 YRB heatwave is featured with an anomalous highpressure system that favors a hot and dry atmospheric column, overlaid by anomalous subsidence and clear skies which leads to warming and greater solar heating. The ensemble constructed circulation analogue analyses show that the circulation anomaly fails to explain the observed 2022 YRB SAT anomalies fully. Specifically, 46\% (0.132 ± 0.027°C decade 1) of the observed SAT trend during 1979–2022 (0.290 ± 0.048°C decade 1) is caused by anthropogenic warming and the associated thermodynamic feedback, while the remaining 54\% (0.157 ± 0.038°C decade 1) of the trend is caused by changes in the large‐scale atmospheric circulation. Our findings on changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with YRB heatwave and anthropogenic contributions to YRB heatwave could provide valuable information for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in the context of a warming climate.},

	abstract = {The frequency of large-scale anomalous precipitation events over China has increased during 1961–2018. However, it remains challenging to understand the mechanisms associated with these anomalous events showing different spatial patterns. Here, we applied an autoencoder technique to identify large-scale anomalous precipitation events for both observations and model simulations, which were then classiﬁed into several patterns through a self-organizing map method. The synoptic behavior and atmospheric circulation background of different anomalous patterns were also analyzed using simultaneous composite analyses. Results show that occurrences of different anomalous precipitation patterns have increased signiﬁcantly, except those centered in North China, Northeast China, and the Yangtze River basin. The anomalous precipitation patterns manifest various intraseasonal distributions, which are linked to zonal oscillations of the western North Paciﬁc subtropical high (WNPSH) and meridional displacements of East Asia westerly jet (EAJ). Accompanied by the westward movement of WNPSH, anticyclonic systems transport warm moist air from the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea to converge with the cold air caused by anomalous cyclones over the northwest ﬂank of the WNPSH, leading to large-scale anomalous precipitation in these regions. Besides WNPSH, the northward and southward displacements of EAJ also favor the occurrence of anomalous precipitation events in northern and southern China, respectively. Our study also illustrates that the occurrence frequency of anomalous precipitation events is projected to increase remarkably under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5 (SSP585) scenario by rates of twofold to fourfold.},

	abstract = {Precipitation whiplash, including abrupt shifts between wet and dry extremes, can cause large adverse impacts on human and natural systems. Here we quantify observed and projected changes in characteristics of sub-seasonal precipitation whiplash and investigate the role of individual anthropogenic influences on these changes. Results show that the occurrence frequency of global precipitation whiplash is projected to be 2.56 ± 0.16 times higher than in 1979–2019 by the end of the 21st Century, with increasingly rapid and intense transitions between two extremes. The most dramatic increases of whiplash show in the polar and monsoon regions. Changes in precipitation whiplash show a much higher percentage change than precipitation totals. In historical simulations, anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol emissions have increased and decreased precipitation whiplash occurrences, respectively. By 2079, anthropogenic GHGs are projected to increase 55 ± 4\% of the occurrences risk of precipitation whiplash, which is driven by shifts in circulation patterns conducive to precipitation extremes.},

	abstract = {Southeastern China experienced a drying trend and the precipitation deficit in 2020 exerts great stress to the water supply and the environment. This paper analyzed the large-scale climate patterns relating to the precip­ itation deficit in 2020 and attribute the decreasing precipitation and drought over southeastern China based on observations and large GCM ensembles, including HadGEM3-GA6 and CESM LENS single forcing simulations. Results show that the precipitation deficit in 2020 mostly results from the anomalously persistent WPSH over South China and a lack of cold air intrusion to South China, and it is also associated with the La Nin˜a-like Pacific. Detection analyses show that anthropogenic influences have resulted in decreasing precipitation. The aerosol emissions, including industrial aerosols (AER) and biomass burning aerosols (BMB), have substantially decreased precipitation over southeastern China, while the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) have slightly increased pre­ cipitation. Because the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation are larger than the GHG effects of increasing precipitation, precipitation shows a decreasing trend in recent decades. However, as the aerosols emission from industry and biomass burning decreases, the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation will be reduced. Future precipitation over southeastern China is projected to increase due to the GHG effects of increasing precipitation. There were AER and BMB impacts on occurrences of drought over southeastern China, but the anthropogenic GHG impacts on the intensity, duration, and severity of drought are not detectable.},

	abstract = {Large-scale extreme precipitation (LSExP) events, characterized by widespread extent, persistence, and high intensity, can pose devastating threats to millions of people, infrastructure, and ecology in highly urbanized southeastern China. Here we explore the three-dimensional (spatial and temporal) characteristics and movements of LSExPs and their direct drivers (vertical velocity, water vapor and moisture advection) under six synoptic-scale circulation patterns in southeastern China. LSExPs are classified as low-pressure or non-low types based on circulation anomaly patterns. The low-pressure LSExPs are associated with anomalous cyclonic low-pressure systems in the mid- and lower-troposphere, occurring with main coastal precipitation, while the non-low LSExPs mainly result from cold-warm air convergence and primarily affect inland areas. Low-pressure LSExPs exhibit relatively high intensity compared to non-low types, particularly on days featuring a south-low and north-high dipole pattern, which tend to produce more localized and intense precipitation events. Non-low LSExPs show larger precipitation areas, longer durations, and greater movement distances, and thus impact wider regions, compared to low-pressure LSExPs. Single high-pressure or low-pressure systems are less likely to result in LSExPs, and LSExPs are less severe if occur, compared to other types. All LSExP types move in a direction similar to that of moisture transport, strongly influenced by extreme upward motion of moisture. Low-pressure LSExPs are more related to the upward motion of the atmosphere at 850 hPa, and they also involve extreme water vapor and moisture transport.},

	abstract = {Acid rain, characterized by pH values lower than 5.6, is a critical natural disturbance of ecosystems, which threatens the sustainability of ecosystems, agriculture, and human society worldwide. However, accurately quantifying the driving factors of acid rain remains challenging due to a changing environment of significant spatial heterogeneity. Here, we established an explainable machine-learning framework (MLF) using 19 meteorological, air pollutant, and land surface variables as model input to construct the pH values of acid rain across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) during 2006–2021. The MLF includes Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for acid deposition prediction and a SHapley Additive exPlanations method (SHAP) for interpreting factor importance. The results indicated that the observed increases in pH values of acid rain are predominantly controlled by the significant decreases in maximum daily sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentration of air across GBA, with its relative contribution ranging from 16.2\% to 31.9\% for each city. Changes in the urbanization rate and the proximity to the coast also play significant roles in predicting the pH values of acid rain. Meteorological variables typically have minimal impact on acid rain predictions, with their contribution generally being less than 5\%, indicating the complex physical process of acid rain generation. This study enhanced our comprehension of the spatial variability of acid rain drivers across a highly developed region, providing valuable insights and case studies for regions worldwide that frequently experience acid rain.},

	abstract = {Flash droughts can induce serious adverse effects on local ecology due to their rapid intensification. However, individual flash drought events have not been thoroughly analyzed to demonstrate their dynamic evolution and changes. Here we use a 3-D connectivity algorithm to identify large contiguous flash drought events globally from an event-based perspective, which allows for effective tracking of their full spatiotemporal development. Results show that during 1980–2020, 2322 large contiguous flash drought events occurred and mainly distributed globally in nine hotspots, with a strong seasonal preference for warm seasons. Flash drought events of longer lifetime and travel distance are more likely to occur at the high-latitudes. The intensity, duration, and frequency of these events increase statistically significantly, while their affected area and translation speed decrease. Although regional variations in propagation patterns exist, flash drought events tend to propagate more toward the northeast. Across much of the globe, the preceding meteorological conditions in over 50\% of flash droughts are marked by the concurrence of elevated regional temperatures and precipitation deficits. The dominant role of individual drivers exhibits notable spatial heterogeneity, largely influenced by the latitude and regional weather systems. Precipitation deficits tend to be the primary driver in monsoon-affected regions, while elevated temperatures predominantly govern flash drought onset in the high-latitudes of the Eurasian continent. Precipitation deficits primarily (38.9\%) determine the intensity of flash droughts, while high temperatures play a dominant role (42.2\%) in the duration of flash droughts. Our results provide a new perspective for future projection of drought events.},
