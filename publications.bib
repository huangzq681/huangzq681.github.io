	abstract = {The unprecedented 2022 Yangtze River Basin heatwave is a threat to human society and natural ecology, so the understanding of its underlying drivers is critical to regional climate adaptation and resilience. Here we conducted a multi‐method attribution analysis on the contribution of atmospheric circulation change and anthropogenic impacts to the occurrence probability and intensity of this extreme heatwave. Based on the nonstationary statistical analysis, the 2022 YRB heatwave is a 1‐in‐900‐year event and a 1‐in‐110‐year event with and without considering the 2022 YRB heatwave in the fitting, respectively. The large‐scale meteorological condition analysis shows that the 2022 YRB heatwave is featured with an anomalous highpressure system that favors a hot and dry atmospheric column, overlaid by anomalous subsidence and clear skies which leads to warming and greater solar heating. The ensemble constructed circulation analogue analyses show that the circulation anomaly fails to explain the observed 2022 YRB SAT anomalies fully. Specifically, 46\% (0.132 ± 0.027°C decade 1) of the observed SAT trend during 1979–2022 (0.290 ± 0.048°C decade 1) is caused by anthropogenic warming and the associated thermodynamic feedback, while the remaining 54\% (0.157 ± 0.038°C decade 1) of the trend is caused by changes in the large‐scale atmospheric circulation. Our findings on changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with YRB heatwave and anthropogenic contributions to YRB heatwave could provide valuable information for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in the context of a warming climate.},

	abstract = {The frequency of large-scale anomalous precipitation events over China has increased during 1961–2018. However, it remains challenging to understand the mechanisms associated with these anomalous events showing different spatial patterns. Here, we applied an autoencoder technique to identify large-scale anomalous precipitation events for both observations and model simulations, which were then classiﬁed into several patterns through a self-organizing map method. The synoptic behavior and atmospheric circulation background of different anomalous patterns were also analyzed using simultaneous composite analyses. Results show that occurrences of different anomalous precipitation patterns have increased signiﬁcantly, except those centered in North China, Northeast China, and the Yangtze River basin. The anomalous precipitation patterns manifest various intraseasonal distributions, which are linked to zonal oscillations of the western North Paciﬁc subtropical high (WNPSH) and meridional displacements of East Asia westerly jet (EAJ). Accompanied by the westward movement of WNPSH, anticyclonic systems transport warm moist air from the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea to converge with the cold air caused by anomalous cyclones over the northwest ﬂank of the WNPSH, leading to large-scale anomalous precipitation in these regions. Besides WNPSH, the northward and southward displacements of EAJ also favor the occurrence of anomalous precipitation events in northern and southern China, respectively. Our study also illustrates that the occurrence frequency of anomalous precipitation events is projected to increase remarkably under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5 (SSP585) scenario by rates of twofold to fourfold.},

	abstract = {Acid rain, characterized by pH values lower than 5.6, is a critical natural disturbance of ecosystems, which threatens the sustainability of ecosystems, agriculture, and human society worldwide. However, accurately quantifying the driving factors of acid rain remains challenging due to a changing environment of significant spatial heterogeneity. Here, we established an explainable machine-learning framework (MLF) using 19 meteorological, air pollutant, and land surface variables as model input to construct the pH values of acid rain across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) during 2006–2021. The MLF includes Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for acid deposition prediction and a SHapley Additive exPlanations method (SHAP) for interpreting factor importance. The results indicated that the observed increases in pH values of acid rain are predominantly controlled by the significant decreases in maximum daily sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentration of air across GBA, with its relative contribution ranging from 16.2\% to 31.9\% for each city. Changes in the urbanization rate and the proximity to the coast also play significant roles in predicting the pH values of acid rain. Meteorological variables typically have minimal impact on acid rain predictions, with their contribution generally being less than 5\%, indicating the complex physical process of acid rain generation. This study enhanced our comprehension of the spatial variability of acid rain drivers across a highly developed region, providing valuable insights and case studies for regions worldwide that frequently experience acid rain.},
