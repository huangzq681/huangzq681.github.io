	abstract = {Precipitation whiplash, including abrupt shifts between wet and dry extremes, can cause large adverse impacts on human and natural systems. Here we quantify observed and projected changes in characteristics of sub-seasonal precipitation whiplash and investigate the role of individual anthropogenic influences on these changes. Results show that the occurrence frequency of global precipitation whiplash is projected to be 2.56‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.16 times higher than in 1979‚Äì2019 by the end of the 21st Century, with increasingly rapid and intense transitions between two extremes. The most dramatic increases of whiplash show in the polar and monsoon regions. Changes in precipitation whiplash show a much higher percentage change than precipitation totals. In historical simulations, anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol emissions have increased and decreased precipitation whiplash occurrences, respectively. By 2079, anthropogenic GHGs are projected to increase 55‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4\% of the occurrences risk of precipitation whiplash, which is driven by shifts in circulation patterns conducive to precipitation extremes.},

	abstract = {Southeastern China experienced a drying trend and the precipitation deficit in 2020 exerts great stress to the water supply and the environment. This paper analyzed the large-scale climate patterns relating to the precip¬≠ itation deficit in 2020 and attribute the decreasing precipitation and drought over southeastern China based on observations and large GCM ensembles, including HadGEM3-GA6 and CESM LENS single forcing simulations. Results show that the precipitation deficit in 2020 mostly results from the anomalously persistent WPSH over South China and a lack of cold air intrusion to South China, and it is also associated with the La NinÀúa-like Pacific. Detection analyses show that anthropogenic influences have resulted in decreasing precipitation. The aerosol emissions, including industrial aerosols (AER) and biomass burning aerosols (BMB), have substantially decreased precipitation over southeastern China, while the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) have slightly increased pre¬≠ cipitation. Because the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation are larger than the GHG effects of increasing precipitation, precipitation shows a decreasing trend in recent decades. However, as the aerosols emission from industry and biomass burning decreases, the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation will be reduced. Future precipitation over southeastern China is projected to increase due to the GHG effects of increasing precipitation. There were AER and BMB impacts on occurrences of drought over southeastern China, but the anthropogenic GHG impacts on the intensity, duration, and severity of drought are not detectable.},

	abstract = {Large-scale extreme precipitation (LSExP) events, characterized by widespread extent, persistence, and high intensity, can pose devastating threats to millions of people, infrastructure, and ecology in highly urbanized southeastern China. Here we explore the three-dimensional (spatial and temporal) characteristics and movements of LSExPs and their direct drivers (vertical velocity, water vapor and moisture advection) under six synoptic-scale circulation patterns in southeastern China. LSExPs are classified as low-pressure or non-low types based on circulation anomaly patterns. The low-pressure LSExPs are associated with anomalous cyclonic low-pressure systems in the mid- and lower-troposphere, occurring with main coastal precipitation, while the non-low LSExPs mainly result from cold-warm air convergence and primarily affect inland areas. Low-pressure LSExPs exhibit relatively high intensity compared to non-low types, particularly on days featuring a south-low and north-high dipole pattern, which tend to produce more localized and intense precipitation events. Non-low LSExPs show larger precipitation areas, longer durations, and greater movement distances, and thus impact wider regions, compared to low-pressure LSExPs. Single high-pressure or low-pressure systems are less likely to result in LSExPs, and LSExPs are less severe if occur, compared to other types. All LSExP types move in a direction similar to that of moisture transport, strongly influenced by extreme upward motion of moisture. Low-pressure LSExPs are more related to the upward motion of the atmosphere at 850 hPa, and they also involve extreme water vapor and moisture transport.},

	abstract = {Flash droughts can induce serious adverse effects on local ecology due to their rapid intensification. However, individual flash drought events have not been thoroughly analyzed to demonstrate their dynamic evolution and changes. Here we use a 3-D connectivity algorithm to identify large contiguous flash drought events globally from an event-based perspective, which allows for effective tracking of their full spatiotemporal development. Results show that during 1980‚Äì2020, 2322 large contiguous flash drought events occurred and mainly distributed globally in nine hotspots, with a strong seasonal preference for warm seasons. Flash drought events of longer lifetime and travel distance are more likely to occur at the high-latitudes. The intensity, duration, and frequency of these events increase statistically significantly, while their affected area and translation speed decrease. Although regional variations in propagation patterns exist, flash drought events tend to propagate more toward the northeast. Across much of the globe, the preceding meteorological conditions in over 50\% of flash droughts are marked by the concurrence of elevated regional temperatures and precipitation deficits. The dominant role of individual drivers exhibits notable spatial heterogeneity, largely influenced by the latitude and regional weather systems. Precipitation deficits tend to be the primary driver in monsoon-affected regions, while elevated temperatures predominantly govern flash drought onset in the high-latitudes of the Eurasian continent. Precipitation deficits primarily (38.9\%) determine the intensity of flash droughts, while high temperatures play a dominant role (42.2\%) in the duration of flash droughts. Our results provide a new perspective for future projection of drought events.},
