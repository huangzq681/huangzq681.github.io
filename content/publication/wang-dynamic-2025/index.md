abstract: Flash droughts can induce serious adverse effects on local ecology due to
  their rapid intensification. However, individual flash drought events have not been
  thoroughly analyzed to demonstrate their dynamic evolution and changes. Here we
  use a 3-D connectivity algorithm to identify large contiguous flash drought events
  globally from an event-based perspective, which allows for effective tracking of
  their full spatiotemporal development. Results show that during 1980â€“2020, 2322
  large contiguous flash drought events occurred and mainly distributed globally in
  nine hotspots, with a strong seasonal preference for warm seasons. Flash drought
  events of longer lifetime and travel distance are more likely to occur at the high-latitudes.
  The intensity, duration, and frequency of these events increase statistically significantly,
  while their affected area and translation speed decrease. Although regional variations
  in propagation patterns exist, flash drought events tend to propagate more toward
  the northeast. Across much of the globe, the preceding meteorological conditions
  in over 50% of flash droughts are marked by the concurrence of elevated regional
  temperatures and precipitation deficits. The dominant role of individual drivers
  exhibits notable spatial heterogeneity, largely influenced by the latitude and regional
  weather systems. Precipitation deficits tend to be the primary driver in monsoon-affected
  regions, while elevated temperatures predominantly govern flash drought onset in
  the high-latitudes of the Eurasian continent. Precipitation deficits primarily (38.9%)
  determine the intensity of flash droughts, while high temperatures play a dominant
  role (42.2%) in the duration of flash droughts. Our results provide a new perspective
  for future projection of drought events.
