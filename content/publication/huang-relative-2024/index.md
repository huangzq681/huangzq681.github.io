abstract: The unprecedented 2022 Yangtze River Basin heatwave is a threat to human
  society and natural ecology, so the understanding of its underlying drivers is critical
  to regional climate adaptation and resilience. Here we conducted a multi‐method
  attribution analysis on the contribution of atmospheric circulation change and anthropogenic
  impacts to the occurrence probability and intensity of this extreme heatwave. Based
  on the nonstationary statistical analysis, the 2022 YRB heatwave is a 1‐in‐900‐year
  event and a 1‐in‐110‐year event with and without considering the 2022 YRB heatwave
  in the fitting, respectively. The large‐scale meteorological condition analysis
  shows that the 2022 YRB heatwave is featured with an anomalous highpressure system
  that favors a hot and dry atmospheric column, overlaid by anomalous subsidence and
  clear skies which leads to warming and greater solar heating. The ensemble constructed
  circulation analogue analyses show that the circulation anomaly fails to explain
  the observed 2022 YRB SAT anomalies fully. Specifically, 46% (0.132 ± 0.027°C decade
  1) of the observed SAT trend during 1979–2022 (0.290 ± 0.048°C decade 1) is caused
  by anthropogenic warming and the associated thermodynamic feedback, while the remaining
  54% (0.157 ± 0.038°C decade 1) of the trend is caused by changes in the large‐scale
  atmospheric circulation. Our findings on changes in atmospheric circulation patterns
  associated with YRB heatwave and anthropogenic contributions to YRB heatwave could
  provide valuable information for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in
  the context of a warming climate.
