 abstract = {The unprecedented 2022 Yangtze River Basin heatwave is a threat to human society and natural ecology, so the understanding of its underlying drivers is critical to regional climate adaptation and resilience. Here we conducted a multi‐method attribution analysis on the contribution of atmospheric circulation change and anthropogenic impacts to the occurrence probability and intensity of this extreme heatwave. Based on the nonstationary statistical analysis, the 2022 YRB heatwave is a 1‐in‐900‐year event and a 1‐in‐110‐year event with and without considering the 2022 YRB heatwave in the fitting, respectively. The large‐scale meteorological condition analysis shows that the 2022 YRB heatwave is featured with an anomalous highpressure system that favors a hot and dry atmospheric column, overlaid by anomalous subsidence and clear skies which leads to warming and greater solar heating. The ensemble constructed circulation analogue analyses show that the circulation anomaly fails to explain the observed 2022 YRB SAT anomalies fully. Specifically, 46% (0.132 ± 0.027°C decade 1) of the observed SAT trend during 1979–2022 (0.290 ± 0.048°C decade 1) is caused by anthropogenic warming and the associated thermodynamic feedback, while the remaining 54% (0.157 ± 0.038°C decade 1) of the trend is caused by changes in the large‐scale atmospheric circulation. Our findings on changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with YRB heatwave and anthropogenic contributions to YRB heatwave could provide valuable information for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in the context of a warming climate.},
