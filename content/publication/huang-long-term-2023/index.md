abstract: The frequency of large-scale anomalous precipitation events over China has
  increased during 1961–2018. However, it remains challenging to understand the mechanisms
  associated with these anomalous events showing different spatial patterns. Here,
  we applied an autoencoder technique to identify large-scale anomalous precipitation
  events for both observations and model simulations, which were then classiﬁed into
  several patterns through a self-organizing map method. The synoptic behavior and
  atmospheric circulation background of different anomalous patterns were also analyzed
  using simultaneous composite analyses. Results show that occurrences of different
  anomalous precipitation patterns have increased signiﬁcantly, except those centered
  in North China, Northeast China, and the Yangtze River basin. The anomalous precipitation
  patterns manifest various intraseasonal distributions, which are linked to zonal
  oscillations of the western North Paciﬁc subtropical high (WNPSH) and meridional
  displacements of East Asia westerly jet (EAJ). Accompanied by the westward movement
  of WNPSH, anticyclonic systems transport warm moist air from the Indian Ocean and
  the South China Sea to converge with the cold air caused by anomalous cyclones over
  the northwest ﬂank of the WNPSH, leading to large-scale anomalous precipitation
  in these regions. Besides WNPSH, the northward and southward displacements of EAJ
  also favor the occurrence of anomalous precipitation events in northern and southern
  China, respectively. Our study also illustrates that the occurrence frequency of
  anomalous precipitation events is projected to increase remarkably under the Shared
  Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5 (SSP585) scenario by rates of twofold to fourfold.
