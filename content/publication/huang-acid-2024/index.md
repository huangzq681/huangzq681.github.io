abstract: Acid rain, characterized by pH values lower than 5.6, is a critical natural
  disturbance of ecosystems, which threatens the sustainability of ecosystems, agriculture,
  and human society worldwide. However, accurately quantifying the driving factors
  of acid rain remains challenging due to a changing environment of significant spatial
  heterogeneity. Here, we established an explainable machine-learning framework (MLF)
  using 19 meteorological, air pollutant, and land surface variables as model input
  to construct the pH values of acid rain across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater
  Bay Area (GBA) during 2006â€“2021. The MLF includes Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
  for acid deposition prediction and a SHapley Additive exPlanations method (SHAP)
  for interpreting factor importance. The results indicated that the observed increases
  in pH values of acid rain are predominantly controlled by the significant decreases
  in maximum daily sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentration of air across GBA, with its
  relative contribution ranging from 16.2% to 31.9% for each city. Changes in the
  urbanization rate and the proximity to the coast also play significant roles in
  predicting the pH values of acid rain. Meteorological variables typically have minimal
  impact on acid rain predictions, with their contribution generally being less than
  5%, indicating the complex physical process of acid rain generation. This study
  enhanced our comprehension of the spatial variability of acid rain drivers across
  a highly developed region, providing valuable insights and case studies for regions
  worldwide that frequently experience acid rain.
