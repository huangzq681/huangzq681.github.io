        I am particularly interested in multi-disciplinary climate change fields. My research topics aim to understand the role of water and the associated hydrological processes in regulating global environmental changes in the present and future. While much of my research focuses on the physical mechanisms in climate extremes, e.g., extreme precipitation, heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, I am also interested in how these extremes affect the ecology, human, and socioeconomic systems.  
        
        Besides the traditional analyzing methods, I am very enthusiastic about using the knowledge of artificial intelligence approaches to comprehend the causes and consequences of these hydrological extremes. My research topics are summarized as followed.

        ### Impacts of Climate Change and ENSO variabilities on Snow droughts in Asian Water Tower
        
        The Tibetan Plateau has experienced increasingly unprecedented snow droughts under climate warming, raising concerns about regional ecosystem sustainability and water resource security. While warming and drying are primary drivers, the specific roles of anthropogenic warming and climate variability in affecting these drivers and, consequently, the occurrence of snow drought remain unknown. In this study, we incorporated multi-source snowpack data and leveraged climate simulations to provide a detailed analysis of snow drought occurrence and trends across the TP. Our results provide critical insights into the driving mechanisms of snow droughts in this climate-sensitive region, aiming to support decision-makers in advancing climate resilience and sustainable water management. (Under review)

        ### A Lagrangian Investigation of the Physical Processes of Heatwaves in South China

        In the context of global warming, the growing frequency of heatwaves poses significant risks to agriculture production, water resource management, and public health. While previous studies have primarily relied on composite analyses of background atmospheric circulation to characterize dry and wet heatwaves, they provide limited insight into the underlying physical processes. Meanwhile, the sources and transport of heat and moisture in heatwave dynamics remain unresolved. Here, we applied Lagrangian backward tracking and heat budget decompositions to provide a complete picture of source regions, typical transport patterns, and physical  processes in the air masses for different temperature extremes.

        ### Future Directions
        
        Looking ahead, my research will focus on:
        1. **Multi-model ensemble approaches** for better uncertainty quantification
        2. **High-resolution climate modeling** at regional scales  
        3. **Interdisciplinary collaborations** bridging climate science and policy
