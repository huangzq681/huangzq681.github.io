abstract: Precipitation whiplash, including abrupt shifts between wet and dry extremes,
  can cause large adverse impacts on human and natural systems. Here we quantify observed
  and projected changes in characteristics of sub-seasonal precipitation whiplash
  and investigate the role of individual anthropogenic influences on these changes.
  Results show that the occurrence frequency of global precipitation whiplash is projected
  to be 2.56 ± 0.16 times higher than in 1979–2019 by the end of the 21st Century,
  with increasingly rapid and intense transitions between two extremes. The most dramatic
  increases of whiplash show in the polar and monsoon regions. Changes in precipitation
  whiplash show a much higher percentage change than precipitation totals. In historical
  simulations, anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol emissions have increased
  and decreased precipitation whiplash occurrences, respectively. By 2079, anthropogenic
  GHGs are projected to increase 55 ± 4% of the occurrences risk of precipitation
  whiplash, which is driven by shifts in circulation patterns conducive to precipitation
  extremes.
