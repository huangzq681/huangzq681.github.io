abstract: Southeastern China experienced a drying trend and the precipitation deficit
  in 2020 exerts great stress to the water supply and the environment. This paper
  analyzed the large-scale climate patterns relating to the precip­ itation deficit
  in 2020 and attribute the decreasing precipitation and drought over southeastern
  China based on observations and large GCM ensembles, including HadGEM3-GA6 and CESM
  LENS single forcing simulations. Results show that the precipitation deficit in
  2020 mostly results from the anomalously persistent WPSH over South China and a
  lack of cold air intrusion to South China, and it is also associated with the La
  Nin˜a-like Pacific. Detection analyses show that anthropogenic influences have resulted
  in decreasing precipitation. The aerosol emissions, including industrial aerosols
  (AER) and biomass burning aerosols (BMB), have substantially decreased precipitation
  over southeastern China, while the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) have slightly
  increased pre­ cipitation. Because the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation
  are larger than the GHG effects of increasing precipitation, precipitation shows
  a decreasing trend in recent decades. However, as the aerosols emission from industry
  and biomass burning decreases, the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation
  will be reduced. Future precipitation over southeastern China is projected to increase
  due to the GHG effects of increasing precipitation. There were AER and BMB impacts
  on occurrences of drought over southeastern China, but the anthropogenic GHG impacts
  on the intensity, duration, and severity of drought are not detectable.
