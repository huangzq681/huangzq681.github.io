    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am currently a PhD student at Sun Yat-sen University，concurrently pursuing joint training at the University of Tokyo funded by the CSC scholarship. I collectively receive supervision from Prof. Bingjun Liu and Prof. Xuezhi Tan at SYSU, and Prof. Taikan OKI at UTokyo. I am particularly interested in atmospheric dynamics of climate extremes and the interaction between dynamics and thermodynamics.  
My current current research focuses on decomposing the physical processes and tracking the sources of climate extremes, including extreme precipitation, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves, using time series and data analyses, artificial intelligence, and climate model simulations. I am also interested in understanding how these extremes affect the ecology, human, and socioeconomic systems in the present and future.
